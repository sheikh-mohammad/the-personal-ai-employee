# AGENTS - General Agent Governance

## Purpose

This vault is where I (human) and Claude Code (General Agent) work together on business workflows.

## Workspace Structure

└── AGENTS.md # This file (governance)

## Governance Rules

1. **Skills go in `.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`**
2. **Agents go in `.claude/agents/{name}.md`**
3. **Skills for guidance (2-4 decisions), agents for reasoning (5+)**
4. **Always read this file before operating**
