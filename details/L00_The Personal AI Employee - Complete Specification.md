# The Personal AI Employee - Complete Specification

**Your life and business on autopilot. Local-first, agent-driven, human-in-the-loop.**

This document is your complete architectural blueprint for building a "Digital FTE" (Full-Time Equivalent) - an AI agent that proactively manages your personal and business affairs 24/7. You can also think of it as a "Smart Consultant" or General Agent.

This chapter takes the concept of a "Personal AI Employee" to its logical extreme. It doesn't just wait for you to type; it proactively manages your **Personal Affairs** (Gmail, WhatsApp, Bank) and your **Business** (Social Media, Payments, Project Tasks) using **Claude Code** as the reasoning engine and **Obsidian** as the management dashboard.

**Standout Feature**: The "Monday Morning CEO Briefing," where the AI autonomously audits bank transactions and tasks to report revenue and bottlenecks, transforms the AI from a chatbot into a proactive business partner.

## Digital FTE: The New Unit of Value

A Digital FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) is an AI agent that is built, "hired," and priced as if it were a human employee. This shifts the conversation from "software licenses" to "headcount budgets."

### Human FTE vs Digital FTE

Feature

Human FTE

Digital FTE

Availability

40 hours / week

168 hours / week (24/7)

Monthly Cost

$4,000 – $8,000+

$500 – $2,000

Ramp-up Time

3 – 6 Months

Instant (via Skills)

Consistency

Variable (85–95% accuracy)

Predictable (99%+ consistency)

Scaling

Linear (Hire 10 for 10x work)

Exponential (Instant duplication)

Cost per Task

~$3.00 – $6.00

~$0.25 – $0.50

Annual Hours

~2,000 hours

~8,760 hours

**The 'Aha!' Moment**: A Digital FTE works nearly 9,000 hours a year vs a human's 2,000. The cost per task reduction (from ~$5.00 to ~$0.50) is an **85–90% cost saving** — usually the threshold where a CEO approves a project without further debate.

## Architecture: Perception → Reasoning → Action

Your Personal AI Employee has three layers:

```

### Layer 1: Perception (The "Watchers")

Since Claude Code can't "listen" to the internet 24/7, you use lightweight **Python Sentinel Scripts** running in the background:

-   **Gmail Watcher**: Monitors Gmail API for urgent/important messages, saves as `.md` files in `/Needs_Action/`
-   **WhatsApp Watcher**: Uses Playwright to monitor WhatsApp Web for keywords like "urgent", "invoice", "payment"
-   **File Watcher**: Monitors a drop folder for new files to process

These watchers solve the "lazy agent" problem by waking the agent up rather than waiting for user input.

### Layer 2: Reasoning (Claude Code)

When a Watcher detects a change, it triggers Claude Code:

1.  **Read**: Check `/Needs_Action/` and relevant folders
2.  **Think**: Analyze what needs to be done
3.  **Plan**: Create a `Plan.md` in Obsidian with checkboxes
4.  **Write**: Draft responses, create files
5.  **Request Approval**: For sensitive actions, create approval request files

### Layer 3: Action (MCP Servers)

Claude uses MCP servers to act on the external world:

Server

Capabilities

Use Case

filesystem

Read, write, list files

Built-in, use for vault

gmail-mcp

Send, draft, search emails

Gmail integration

browser-mcp

Navigate, click, fill forms

Payment portals

calendar-mcp

Create, update events

Scheduling

## Technical Specifications

### 1\. Vault Structure

```
ai-vault/├── .claude/│   ├── skills/           # Reusable expertise (SKILL.md format)│   └── agents/           # Autonomous workers├── Needs_Action/         # Watcher deposits files here├── Plans/                # Claude creates plans here├── Pending_Approval/     # Sensitive actions await approval├── Approved/             # Human moves files here to approve├── Rejected/             # Human moves files here to reject├── Done/                 # Completed items archive├── Logs/                 # Audit trail (JSON)├── Accounting/           # Financial tracking├── references/           # Supporting documents├── Dashboard.md          # Real-time summary├── Company_Handbook.md   # Rules of engagement├── Business_Goals.md     # Objectives and metrics├── CLAUDE.md             # Entry point for Claude Code└── AGENTS.md             # Governance rules
```

### 2\. Watcher Pattern

All Watchers follow this pattern:

Method

Purpose

Output

`check_for_updates()`

Poll external source (Gmail API, filesystem, etc.)

List of new items

`create_action_file(item)`

Convert item to markdown in `/Needs_Action/`

Path to created file

`run()`

Infinite loop: check → process → sleep

Continuous operation

**Key requirements:**

-   Configurable check interval (default: 60 seconds)
-   Error handling with logging (never crash silently)
-   Output files trigger Claude Code reasoning

*Full implementation provided in L08: Your Employee's Senses*

### 3\. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern

For sensitive actions, Claude writes an approval request file instead of acting directly:

```
# /Vault/Pending_Approval/PAYMENT_Client_A_2026-01-07.md---type: approval_requestaction: paymentamount: 500.00recipient: Client Areason: Invoice #1234 paymentcreated: 2026-01-07T10:30:00Zexpires: 2026-01-08T10:30:00Zstatus: pending---## Payment Details- Amount: $500.00- To: Client A (Bank: XXXX1234)- Reference: Invoice #1234## To ApproveMove this file to /Approved folder.## To RejectMove this file to /Rejected folder.
```

### 4\. Permission Boundaries

Action Category

Auto-Approve Threshold

Always Require Approval

Email replies

To known contacts\*

New contacts, bulk sends

Payments

< $50 recurring

All new payees, > $100

Social media

Scheduled posts

Replies, DMs

File operations

Create, read

Delete, move outside vault

*\*Known contacts: people you've exchanged 3+ emails with in the past 90 days AND whose address is in your contacts or CRM. Define this threshold in your `Company_Handbook.md`.*

### 5\. Continuous vs Scheduled Operations

Operation Type

Example Task

Trigger

**Scheduled**

Daily Briefing at 8:00 AM

cron / Task Scheduler

**Continuous**

Watch for "Pricing" keyword in WhatsApp

Python watchdog script

**Project-Based**

Categorize 3 months of expenses

Manual file drop

## The CEO Briefing (Silver Tier Feature)

The signature feature that transforms AI from chatbot to business partner:

### Trigger

A scheduled task runs every Sunday night.

### Process

Claude Code reads:

1.  `Business_Goals.md` - Your objectives and metrics
2.  `/Done/` folder - Completed tasks this week
3.  `/Logs/` - Financial data and transaction history

### Deliverable

A "Monday Morning CEO Briefing" highlighting:

-   **Revenue**: Total earned this week
-   **Bottlenecks**: Tasks that took too long
-   **Proactive Suggestions**: "I noticed we spent $200 on unused software subscriptions"

### Template

```
# /Vault/Briefings/2026-01-06_Monday_Briefing.md---generated: 2026-01-06T07:00:00Zperiod: 2025-12-30 to 2026-01-05---# Monday Morning CEO Briefing## Executive SummaryStrong week with revenue ahead of target.

Move to /Pending_Approval### Upcoming Deadlines- Project Alpha final delivery: Jan 15 (9 days)- Quarterly tax prep: Jan 31 (25 days)---_Generated by Personal AI Employee v1.0_
```

* * *

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### Credential Management

-   Never store credentials in plain text or in your Obsidian vault
-   Use environment variables for API keys
-   Create a `.env` file (add to `.gitignore` immediately)
-   Rotate credentials monthly

### Sandboxing

-   **DEV\_MODE flag**: Prevents real external actions during development
-   **\--dry-run flag**: Logs intended actions without executing
-   **Rate limiting**: Max 10 emails/hour, max 3 payments/hour

### Audit Logging

Every action must be logged:

```
{  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:30:00Z",  "action_type": "email_send",  "actor": "claude_code",  "target": "client@example.com",  "parameters": { "subject": "Invoice #123" },  "approval_status": "approved",  "approved_by": "human",  "result": "success"}
```

Store logs in `/Vault/Logs/YYYY-MM-DD.json` and retain for minimum 90 days.

* * *

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Error Categories

Category

Examples

Recovery Strategy

Transient

Network timeout, API rate limit

Exponential backoff retry

Authentication

Expired token, revoked access

Alert human, pause operations

Logic

Claude misinterprets message

Human review queue

Data

Corrupted file, missing field

Quarantine + alert

System

Orchestrator crash, disk full

Watchdog + auto-restart

### Graceful Degradation

-   **Gmail API down**: Queue outgoing emails locally, process when restored
-   **Banking API timeout**: Never retry payments automatically, always require fresh approval
-   **Claude Code unavailable**: Watchers continue collecting, queue grows for later processing

## Process Management: Why Watchers Need Supervision

Your Watchers (Gmail, File monitors) are **daemon processes** — designed to run indefinitely. But standard Python scripts are fragile:

-   They terminate when your terminal closes
-   They crash on unhandled exceptions (API timeouts, network blips)
-   They don't auto-recover after system reboot

**The Solution**: A process manager (PM2, supervisord, or systemd) that:

-   **Auto-restarts** crashed processes immediately
-   **Persists across reboots** via OS init system hooks
-   **Captures logs** for debugging silent failures

**Quick Setup** (covered in L10):

```
# Install PM2npm install -g pm2# Start watcher with auto-restartpm2 start gmail_watcher.py --interpreter python3# Persist across rebootspm2 save && pm2 startup
```

* * *

## Troubleshooting FAQ

### Setup Issues

**Q: Claude Code says "command not found"** A: Ensure Claude Code is installed globally and your PATH is configured. Run `npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code`, then restart your terminal.

**Q: Obsidian vault isn't being read by Claude** A: Run Claude Code from the vault directory, or use `--cwd /path/to/vault`. Verify file permissions allow read access.

**Q: Gmail API returns 403 Forbidden** A: Your OAuth consent screen may need verification, or you haven't enabled the Gmail API in Google Cloud Console.

### Runtime Issues

**Q: Watcher scripts stop running overnight** A: Use PM2 or supervisord to keep them alive (see L10: Always On Duty).

**Q: Claude is making incorrect decisions** A: Review your `Company_Handbook.md` rules. Add more specific examples. Lower autonomy thresholds so more actions require approval.

**Q: MCP server won't connect** A: Check the server process is running (`ps aux | grep mcp`). Verify paths in `mcp.json` are absolute.

### Security Concerns

**Q: How do I know my credentials are safe?** A: Never commit `.env` files. Use environment variables. Rotate credentials monthly. Implement audit logging.

**Q: What if Claude tries to pay the wrong person?** A: That's why HITL is critical for payments. Any payment action creates an approval file first. Never auto-approve payments to new recipients.

## Example: End-to-End Invoice Flow

This walkthrough demonstrates a complete flow from trigger to action.

### Scenario

A client sends a WhatsApp message asking for an invoice. The AI Employee should: (1) detect the request, (2) generate the invoice, (3) send it via email, and (4) log the transaction.

### Step 1: Detection (WhatsApp Watcher)

```
# Detected message:# From: Client A# Text: "Hey, can you send me the invoice for January?"# Watcher creates:# /Vault/Needs_Action/WHATSAPP_client_a_2026-01-07.md
```

### Step 2: Reasoning (Claude Code)

```
# Claude creates: /Vault/Plans/PLAN_invoice_client_a.md---created: 2026-01-07T10:30:00Zstatus: pending_approval---## ObjectiveGenerate and send January invoice to Client A## Steps- [x] Identify client: Client A (client_a@email.com)- [x] Calculate amount: $1,500 (from /Accounting/Rates.md)- [ ] Generate invoice PDF- [ ] Send via email (REQUIRES APPROVAL)- [ ] Log transaction
```

### Step 3: Approval (Human-in-the-Loop)

Claude creates approval request. You review and move to `/Approved/`.

### Step 4: Action (Email MCP)

The system detects the approved file and sends the email with invoice attached.

### Step 5: Completion

Files move to `/Done/`, Dashboard updated, transaction logged.

## Ethics & Responsible Automation

### When Should AI NOT Act Autonomously?

-   Emotional contexts: Condolence messages, conflict resolution
-   Legal matters: Contract signing, regulatory filings
-   Medical decisions: Health-related actions
-   Financial edge cases: Unusual transactions, large amounts
-   Irreversible actions: Anything that cannot be undone

### Transparency Principles

-   Disclose AI involvement when appropriate
-   Maintain audit trails for all actions
-   Allow contacts to request human-only communication
-   Schedule regular reviews of AI decisions

### The Human Remains Accountable

You are responsible for your AI Employee's actions. Regular oversight isn't optional:

-   **Daily**: 2-minute dashboard check
-   **Weekly**: 15-minute action log review
-   **Monthly**: 1-hour comprehensive audit

* * *

## Try With AI

**Prompt 1: Understand the Architecture**

```
I just read the Personal AI Employee specification. Explain the Perception → Reasoning → Action architecture in your own words. What role does each layer play?
```

**What you're practicing**: Confirming you understand the core architecture before building.

**Prompt 2: Choose Your Tier**

```
Based on my goals of [describe your goals] and available time of [X hours/week], which tier (Bronze/Silver/Gold) should I target? What specific deliverables will I have?
```

**What you're practicing**: Making an informed decision about scope before starting.

**Prompt 3: Map Your Use Case**

```
I want to use this Personal AI Employee for [your domain - e.g., freelance consulting, real estate, content creation]. What would the equivalent of the "Email Assistant" be for my domain? What watchers, skills, and MCP integrations would I need?
```

**What you're practicing**: Translating the email example to your specific domain.

# Lesson 0 Summary: Personal AI Employee Specification

## Key Concepts

1.  **Digital FTE Architecture**: Perception (watchers detect events) → Reasoning (Claude Code analyzes) → Action (MCP servers execute) — the three-layer pattern underlying every component
    
2.  **Tiered Deliverables**: Bronze (email assistant), Silver (watchers + HITL + scheduling + CEO Briefing), Gold (full autonomous pipeline), Hackathon (build from scratch)
    
3.  **Permission Boundaries**: Actions classified as auto-approve (read-only, drafts) vs require-approval (sending emails, financial transactions, data deletion)
    
4.  **Known Contacts Rule**: People you've exchanged 3+ emails with in the past 90 days AND whose address is in your contacts or CRM
    
5.  **Security Model**: Credentials in `.env` (never in vault), MCP for external service access, HITL gates for sensitive operations
    

## Deliverables

-   Understanding of the full Personal AI Employee architecture
